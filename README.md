# Automated-Doggy-Door

## Animal Identification System
A machine learning project designed to create a smart animal identification system inspired by a specialized doggy door. This project utilizes the power of Python along with machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras to build and train a classification model capable of recognizing different animals.

## Project Highlights:
Smart Identification: This project is all about teaching a computer how to identify different animals, much like how a smart door identifies animals that can pass through.

TensorFlow and Keras: These are the libraries mainly used in this project.

Focused Data Collection: The project collected a bunch of animal pictures, with a special focus on one dog named "Bo."

Learning from the Past: Instead of starting from scratch, the project uses a clever trick called transfer learning. It takes a smart model that already knows about images and fine-tunes it to recognize "Bo."

High Accuracy: After all the learning, the system becomes pretty smart! It can identify "Bo" with approx. 96% accuracy.
